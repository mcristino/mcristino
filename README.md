<p> Hello, thank you for visiting! Here's more about me 👇</p>
<p> 

Right now I'm Head of marketing, and design at Sofrapa.pt. 

<strong>AND</strong> about now you're wondering why I'm on github, but I'm doing a Professional Full Stack WebDev Course at Flag.pt. Which is teaching me to work with HTML, CSS, Sass, TailwindCss, Bootstrap, Javascript, React, MySQL, PHP & Laravel, REST APIs, MongoDB, NodeJS, ExpressJS.


I have a weakspot for learning new things and I've always had an interest for developing, ever since I was 14 but back then I decided to follow on my interest in design. 📝
